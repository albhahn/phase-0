/*
// Release 2 - Pseudocode:

// Create function that will return the sum of all numbers of a given array
Input: An array of numbers
Output: Sum of all numbers in the array
Steps:
1. Define a function for "sum", which takes in an array of integers
2. Declare a variable "total_sum", which is equal to 0
3. Iterate through each element in the array
4. Add each element in the array to "total_sum"
5. Return "total_sum"

// Create function that will return the mean of all numbers of a given array
Input: An array of numbers
Output: The mean (average) of all numbers in the array
Steps:
1. Define a function for "mean", which takes in an array of integers
2. Declare a variable "average", which is equal to 0
3. Iterate through each element in the array
4. Add each element in the array to "average"
5. Divide "average" by the length of the array
6. Return "average"

// Create function that will return the median of all numbers a given array
Input: An array of numbers
Output: The median of all numbers in the array
Steps:
1. Define a function for "median", which takes in an array of intergers
2. Sort the array in order from least to greatest
3. Declare a variable equal to the length of the list and divide it by 2.
4. IF the length of the array is odd, return the variable(length / 2)
5. ELSE, return the variable(length/2) + variable[(length/2) - 1] / 2
