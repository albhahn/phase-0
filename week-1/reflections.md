# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
I was able to select at least four time management/productivity ideas that I think can definitely suit me well. The Pomodoro Technique, starting projects/challenges on a smaller level, having a growth mindset, and finding the perfect balance between boredom and anxiety to get "in the zone" were the ones that stood out to me. Time Boxing is basically where a person or group of people set a time limit on a goal or project and stop working once the time limit has been reached, regardless of the completion of goal/project, then reflect and review the work that was accomplished. I currently do not implement any time-management strategies other than trying to give myself at least 5 hours a day for phase 0, so I'm definitely excited to try and expand these strategies. Particularly excited to try The Pomodoro Technique, I know I catch myself not keeping track of how much time it takes for me to complete a coding challenge/exercise, as well as not keeping track of how much time I'm really spending on work. If i can master this technique, I am sure the benefits of it will immediately show.
## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
A shell is basically a program that executes commands from a keyboard and gives them to an operating system to perform. Which is what Bash is, the most popular shell and the standard command line interface for Linux and OS X. The biggest challenge for me going through this material was probably spending too much time on it and trying to memorize every command. I was able to successfully use each command during the crash course except a couple times I was running into issues where I couldn't remove (rmdir) a directory because it said it was not empty, although it was in fact empty after checking multiple times in both GUI and using the 'ls' command. I'm trying to pick some commands that may be more important than others but I'd have to say all of them seem to be needed, if anything, the 'exit' command might be the only one that I personally find not asimportant.

pwd - prints the current working directory that you're in.

ls - lists all the directories available in the current directory that you're in.

mv - used to move both files and directories

cd - change "down" to an available directory

../ - change "up" to a previous directory

touch - this creates an empty file

mkdir - makes a directory

less - pages through a file

rmdir - removes a directory

rm - removes a file

help - I was confused about this command because I thought this was asking for the 'man' command and that 'help' didnt do anything for Unix users but i gave it a try and it actually does give some helpful insights.
