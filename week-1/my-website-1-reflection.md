Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
After creating an account on Github, creating a new repository is quite simple. On the top right of the webpage, click on the "+" symbol and click "New repository", select a simple repository name, click "Initialize this repository with a README", then click "Add a license" and select "MIT License". Now when you go back to your user profile page, your repositories will show. If youd like to clone a repository, click on that repository. Open up your "Terminal" on your computer and navigate to the folder you'd like to clone the repository to. Go back to the GitHug repository page and copy the HTTPS URL located near the bottom right of the page. Back to your Terminal, type "git clone PASTE_URL_YOU_COPIED" and press enter. You will now find the copied repository in your folder.

Describe what open source means.
It means the practice of sharing how a program was made and allows anyone to customize the program any way theyd like by freely distributing the software, with the source code included.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I think Open Source is awesome how it basically encourages anyone who'd like to modify or customize the software. In a sense, it does feel like utopia, especially if that person(s) is interested in the software and applies improvements over the long-term.
Assess the importance of using licenses.
While open source is great and makes it easy for others to contribute to a program or project, using licenses protects the original creator by making sure they at least get some credit for their contributions, as well as preventings others from claiming your work as their own. In addition, applying the right type of license is vital as the type of license plays a huge role on who can contribute to it and how widely it is used.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The concepts of open sourcing and its licensing were very much solidified in this challenge. One "aha" moment that i had was finding out reasons as to why a software would or should be open source. I struggled with following up on all the different types of open source licenses.
