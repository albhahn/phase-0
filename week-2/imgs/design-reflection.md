**What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?**
Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, and Maintenance.

**What is your site's primary goal or purpose?**
The purpose of my site will be to share my work history, background, passions, and projects.

**What kind of content will your site feature?**
It will feature links to my social networks, my picture, contact information, my blog(s), and projects.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**
Their interests will be to see what kind of person and worker I am. My site will be able to address them by providing information 'About me', showing my work/school history, and projects I've worked on .

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.**
The primary action the user should take would be to go through my information and portfolio, then view the best ways to contact me.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**
Targest audience is a key factor that must be considered, as user experience, depends on exactly that, how a user perceives their experience. A website should give value to the user, while making the website easy to navigate/use, and make their experience enjoyable altogether.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**
User experience is designed around how a person feels when interacting with a website, application, or software. It's valuable because a website or application wouldnt be created if it wasn't for wanting others to interact and view them. If we apply UX design, it can help with the website/application's purpose, as well as draw more attention to them.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**
What I found tedious in this challenge was in-depth reading and learning about how UX design is important and its purpose.
