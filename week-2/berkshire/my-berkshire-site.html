<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was actually really fun. I was catching myself wondering if we had the tags correct, and in the right places but we just double checked and assured each other throughout the code/challenge.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
We did a bit of researching on semantic elements but my pair and I were not sure how to use them during the challenge, though I did add some <section> tags afterwards.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think I did well, as I did no formatting to it haha.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
What seems good about it is, its very straight-forward and fairly simple. With that in mind, it seems that it can also be considered bad because it feels a bit limiting but I'm sure theres a lot more to learn with it, including CSS.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I dont think I have any tricks per se, but just more practice with new tags and trying to remember all of the abbreviations.
