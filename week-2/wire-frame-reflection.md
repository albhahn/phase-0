**What is a wireframe?**
A wireframe is like a blueprint, which basically acts like a skeleton of a website.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**
Wireframing is beneficial as it allows a designer to plan the layout and the interaction of an interface before going into colors and design, which can be distracting otherwise.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**
It was fairly simple and I think I can enjoy it much more later as I learn to understand the concepts better(what should go where) and so on.

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**
I pretty much stuck with my first idea, which was to simply show what my website will feature.

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**
A simple question I had for this challenge, was wondering what exactly should go on a footer of a website. I was able to just browse around examples, as well as sites i visit regularly to get an idea.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**
I enjoyed actually putting my wireframe together, hands on. I suppose some of the steps in the beginner's guide was tedious at moments when reading/learning about something I had no idea was being explaing(i.e. the Tools).
